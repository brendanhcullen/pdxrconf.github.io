Heather Nolis is a founding member of the AI @ T-Mobile team, focusing the conversion of cutting-edge analyses to real-time, scalable data-driven products. She began her career in neuroscience but once realized how heavily that field relied on software built by other people, she pivoted - deciding to make software herself. You can find her [@heatherklus](https://twitter.com/heatherklus) on Twitter, where she speaks about diversity in technology, the ethical implications of data, and cats.
 
Dr. Jacqueline Nolis is a co-founder of Nolis, LLC, a data science consulting firm. She has over a decade of experience using data to help companies including DSW, Union Bank, Microsoft, and Airbnb. She has a PhD from Arizona State University where her research focused on electric vehicle route optimization. For fun she likes to use machine learning to do weird things like generate offensive license plates. You can find her [@skyetetra](https://twitter.com/skyetetra) on Twitter.
