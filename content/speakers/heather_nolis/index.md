Heather Nolis is a founding member of the AI @ T-Mobile team, focusing the conversion of cutting-edge analyses to real-time, scalable data-driven products. She began her career in neuroscience but once realized how heavily that field relied on software built by other people, she pivoted - deciding to make software herself. You can find her [@heatherklus](https://twitter.com/heatherklus) on Twitter, where she speaks about diversity in technology, the ethical implications of data, and cats.
