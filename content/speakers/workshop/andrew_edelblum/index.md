Andrew Edelblum is a third-year marketing PhD student at the University of Oregon. His research explores novel and progressive forms of branding that are shaping today’s marketplace, such as the emergent role of brands as political advocates.
 
When Andrew started his PhD journey, he did not see himself as a programmer—let alone a data scientist. He’d never done any coding… minus some tweaks to the aesthetics of his MySpace profile in 2009. However, that all changed when he took R courses during his first two years of graduate school. Andrew fell in love with the customizable ways he could use R to both perform statistical analyses and create beautiful data visualizations.
 
Now, Andrew uses R for work and play constantly. (Ask him about his Spotify playlist project!)
