Ouafaa is pursuing a Ph.D. degree in management at the University of Oregon. Ouafaa received her BS in Industrial Engineering from Ecole Mohamadia dâ€™Ingenieurs and her MPA from Cornell University as a Fulbright Scholar. Her research lies in the intersection of strategy and entrepreneurship economics. Using experimental and quasi-experimental approaches, she investigates the different mechanisms used by intermediaries that finance and support early stage ventures. She also draws upon large-scale data to examine different aspects of the geography of entrepreneurship. Her projects are based in a range of contexts including startup acceleration programs, crowdfunding, and multi-sided platforms.
