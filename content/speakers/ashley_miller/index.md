Ashley is a doctoral student studying cognitive neuroscience at the University of Oregon. Her research combines correlational and experimental techniques to examine memory and attention processes and individual differences within these processes. That is, Ashley’s research seeks to identify sources of limitations in learning ability—and cognitive abilities more broadly—by focusing on how individuals control attention in a goal directed manner. She has recently begun to examine how the amount of attentional resources allocated to learning (intensity), as well as how consistently those resources are allocated to said to-be-learned material (consistency), are associated with ensuing memory performance. Ashley leverages behavioral and physiological techniques (pupillometry and eye-tracking) to address these questions.
