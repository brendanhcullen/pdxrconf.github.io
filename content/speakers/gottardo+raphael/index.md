talk: "The Role of Data Science in Translational Research at Fred Hutch"
---

With recent advances in biomedical technologies, researchers at the Hutch (and elsewhere) are generating datasets at a scale we couldn’t even envision five years ago. This is in addition to the amount of publicly available data that is growing at exponential pace, that could be mined for additional biological information. At the same time, recent advances in statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing the way we think about data, and the way we analyze data. In November 2018, the Fred Hutch launched the Translational Data Science Integrated Research Center (TDS-IRC), a cross-divisional, collaborative research effort that will enable the Hutch to leverage these recent advances — and spur future innovation — in large-scale biological experiments, computational methods and infrastructure. During this presentation I will give an overview of current data science efforts at the Hutch and discuss future directions using concrete examples from our work on infectious diseases, vaccines and cancer immunotherapy.

### Biography

Dr. Gottardo is a pioneer in developing and applying statistical methods and software tools to distill actionable insights from large and complex biological data sets.In partnership with scientists and clinicians, he works to understand such diseases as cancer, HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis and inform the development of vaccines and treatments. He is a leader in forming interdisciplinary collaborations across the Hutch, as well as nationally and internationally, to address important research questions, particularly in the areas of vaccine research, human immunology, and immunotherapy. As director of the Translational Data Science Integrated Research Center, he fosters interaction between the Hutch’s experimental and clinical researchers and their computational and quantitative science colleagues with the goal of transforming patient care through data-driven research. Dr. Gottardo partners closely with the cancer immunotherapy program at Fred Hutch to improve treatments. For example, his team is harnessing cutting-edge computational methods to determine how cancers evade immunotherapy. He has made significant contributions to vaccine research and is the principal investigator of the Vaccine and Immunology Statistical Center of the Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery.
